# SoilXplore – Healthy Soil, Healthier Tomorrow

## 🔍 Project Overview
SoilXplore is a smart soil analysis and recommendation system aimed at promoting healthy soil practices among small-scale farmers and community garden groups. The device empowers users with real-time data and AI-driven insights, enabling them to take timely and informed actions that rejuvenate their soil and improve agricultural yield. 

SoilXplore combines portable sensors, microcontroller technology, and voice feedback with wireless connectivity, offering an easy-to-use and highly informative experience for people of all age groups – including the elderly and children – making it ideal for community gardens, educational programs, and smart farming initiatives.

## 🌱 Problem Statement
Underserved communities and smallholder farmers often lack access to reliable, scientific methods for assessing soil health. This results in:
- Overuse or underuse of fertilizers
- Poor crop yields
- Long-term soil degradation
- Limited awareness about soil nutrition

Existing soil test solutions are either expensive, non-portable, or too complex for everyday use. A need exists for an affordable, easy-to-use, and interactive solution that can provide actionable recommendations to ensure healthy, nutrient-rich soil.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: SoilXplore

SoilXplore is a compact, portable, and voice-assisted soil health monitoring system designed to:

- Measure key soil parameters: **Moisture**, **Temperature**, **pH**, and **NPK** levels
- Provide **voice feedback** in local language for ease of use
- Offer **AI-based recommendations** to improve soil quality and crop yield
- Sync data to a **mobile or web app** via WiFi using the **ESP32** microcontroller
- Use intuitive **LED indicators** to visually represent nutrient status

---

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Microcontroller:
- **ESP32** is used as the central microcontroller due to its built-in WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPIO capabilities.

### Sensors:
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** – Measures the volumetric water content of the soil.
- **Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)** – Provides accurate temperature readings critical for understanding microbial activity.
- **pH Sensor** – Determines soil acidity or alkalinity.
- **NPK Sensor** – Measures Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels using a colorimetric analysis or analog/digital sensor module.
- **LED Indicators** – Display soil nutrient status visually using Red (Low), Yellow (Moderate), Green (Sufficient) LEDs.

### AI Integration:
- **ML model** will be trained on soil health data to provide:
  - Fertilizer recommendations
  - Crop-specific suggestions
  - Soil amendment tips

### Voice Feedback:
- Audio module provides real-time voice instructions and results in regional language to assist users with limited literacy.

### Connectivity:
- ESP32 enables **wireless syncing** of data to a **web or mobile app** for deeper analysis and record-keeping.

## 📈 Development Progress

- ✅ Moisture, Temperature, and pH sensors have been individually calibrated and tested successfully.
- 🔧 Calibration of the **NPK sensor** is currently in progress.
- 🧠 The **machine learning model** for recommendations is under development.
- 🧪 Breadboard prototype is being assembled to validate full system integration.
- 🖱️ **3D design** of the enclosure and portable casing will begin once the breadboard prototype is complete and stable.

---

## 🎯 Impact Goals

- Educate farmers and gardeners about soil health in an interactive and accessible way.
- Reduce overuse of harmful chemicals by giving precise fertilizer recommendations.
- Increase crop yield and biodiversity by restoring soil vitality.
- Enable children, youth, and elderly in communities to participate in smart farming and environmental stewardship.

---

## 📱 Future Scope

- Integration with a **mobile/web dashboard** for historical data and advanced analytics.
- Expansion of AI model to support **more crops and climates**.
- Addition of **language packs** for multilingual voice support.
- Possible extension to **hydroponic nutrient monitoring**.
